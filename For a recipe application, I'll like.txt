For a recipe application, I'll likely need the following collections in your non-relational database:

1. Users

Store user information such as username, email, password (hashed), preferences, saved recipes, etc.
2. Recipes

Store information about individual recipes such as title, description, instructions, cooking time, difficulty level, category (e.g., appetizer, main course, dessert), and possibly a list of ingredients.
3. Ingredients

Store information about individual ingredients such as name, category, nutritional information, and a lot of information about it.
4. Comments

Store comments made by users on recipes including fields for the comment text, user ID, timestamp, etc.
5. Saved Recipes

Stores the recipes in a saved folder so that users can watch it later.
6. Categories

Store predefined categories for recipes to facilitate browsing and filtering.
7. Images/Media

Store images or media associated with recipes.
8. Nutritional Information

Store nutritional information for recipes or individual ingredients.
9. Cooking Tips

A collection to store additional notes or tips related to cooking techniques, substitutions, or other useful information that users might find helpful when following recipes.
10. Activity Logs

Store logs of user interactions with the app, such as login/logout times, recipe views, favorites, etc., for analytics purposes or to improve user experience.
